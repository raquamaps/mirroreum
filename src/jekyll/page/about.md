# Architecture

{% marginfigure 'mf-id-1' '../assets/img/mirroreum.png' '' %}

The "mirroreum" platform builds on a stack of Free and Open-Source technologies. You can find the source code on GitHub at <https://github.com/raquamaps/mirroreum>.

It utilizes *docker* and *docker-compose* for integrating microserver architectural software components.

# Authoring

For web-based authoring of open science work, *ROpenSci* is used, extended with EUBON contributions with *RStudio* for web-based scientific analysis.

# Sharing

For web-friendly sharing of research results, *Jekyll, nginx and shiny* are used to enable web-friendly formats and various integration scenarios.

This Jekyll site is using Tufte-Jekyll design (the Tufte.css) - credits and thanks go to <https://github.com/clayh53/tufte-jekyll> for this great contribution.
