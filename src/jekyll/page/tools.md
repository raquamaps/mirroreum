Some of the contributions included in _mirroreum_ include packages such as:

  - HieRanFor (D3.1) - for details see <https://static.mirroreum.eu/hrf.html>
  - UpScaling (D3.1)
  - downscale (already in CRAN)
  - raquamaps - AquaMaps is described here <https://portal.mirroreum.eu/page/aquamaps.html> and some details about raquamaps - an R implementation of the AquaMaps algorithm - can be found here <https://static.mirroreum.eu/raquamaps-overview.html> 

It also includes work in progress such as 4 files in SI of D3.2 and R code for the alpha adjused SDM.

Note that the above software has been developed mostly under EUBON work packages 3 and 4 and aims at improving tools and methods for data analysis and interfaces and to link the environment to biodiversity through analyses of patterns, processes and trends.

A couple of other packages have been added to provide convenient ways to do geocoding and reverse geocoding as well as publishing results in style. For example:

  - ggmap
  - tufte
  -	tufterhandout
  - rticles
